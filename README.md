# Mobile-Dev-Project

Hi and welcome!

This web-app makes it possible for users to create events on a google map and make them visible for other users at KTH. The student union THS may for example create an event for a stand on campus where they will inform students about THS, and perhaps give out coffee.

Start the app by double-clicking on index.html.

Have a nice day!
